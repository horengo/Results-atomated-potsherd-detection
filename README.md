# Results-atomated-potsherd-detection
These folders include the results of two algorithms for the atomated detection of potsherds using the same orthophotomsaic. The original images were acquired by a DJI Phantom 4 Pro V2.0 flying at a height of around 3m above ground.
Both folders contain the shapefiles ready to be integrated into standard GIS projects.
The orthophotomosaic is also included.
