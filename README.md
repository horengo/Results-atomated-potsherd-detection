# Results-atomated-potsherd-detection
These folders include the results of two algorithms for the automated detection of potsherds using the same orthophotomsaic. The original images were acquired by a DJI Phantom 4 Pro V2.0 flying at a height of around 3m above ground.

Both folders contain shapefiles ready to be integrated into standard GIS software. References to the processes followed to create these files are:

The orthophotomosaic can be downloaded from Google Earth Engine using the following code:

var orthomosaic = ee.Image('users/hao23/sherds/plot591')
Export.image.toDrive({
  image: orthomosaic,
  description: 'orthomosaic',
  maxPixels: 9e12,
  scale: orthomosaic.projection().nominalScale().getInfo(),
  region: orthomosaic
});
